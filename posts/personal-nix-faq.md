title: My personal Nix & NixOS FAQ
---

I use Nix and NixOS every day, but I still feel frustrated because I don't know
how to perform some basic tasks. I have decided to put the questions I ask
myself on this page, and hopefully fill in the answers little by little. This
will serve both as a future reference (to me and others) and as a motivation to
learn to use Nix properly.

Please do not hesitate to [contact me](/contact.html) to suggest answers or improvements.

## How can I get the Nix directory (containing the code and Nix files) of a package?
